# Build a Pytpet in Python
I try to create a tamagochi like in Python 3. 

> Realized by following partially this tutorial (in Python 2) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TburgnvAPLE

Some functionalities were added :
- see the stats (age ; weight ; if it like you or not and level of energy)
- Feed it
- Chat with it (limited dialogues lol)
- Play with it (rock paper cissors, diece game)
- Make it sleep (to recover energy)

It keep in memory all stats when the windows is closed properly (with quit button)



With ASCII Art Interface
---------------
I first program it without interface, using terminal of commands.
Next, I used ASCII art to customize it.

With Tkinter Graphic Interface
---------------

Then, I add a real graphic interface with Tkinter and draw my fishe pypet... Now I try to fix all the bug it causes :)
