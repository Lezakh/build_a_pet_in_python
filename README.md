# Build a Pytpet in Python
I try to create a tamagochi like in Python 3. 

> Realized by following partially this tutorial (in Python 2) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TburgnvAPLE




With ASCII Art Interface
---------------
I first program it without interface, using terminal of commands.
Next, I used ASCII art to customize it.

With Tkinter Graphic Interface
---------------

Then, I add a real graphic interface with Tkinter... Now I try to fix all the bug it causes :)
